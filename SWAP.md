### Swapfile
A loose collection of ideas to quickly resume work

---

Must figure out how preprocessor can both be a System and referenced in the interpreter

Must actually write macro system as recorded in note

At this point swappable preprocessors aren't a target because interaction with module system sounds complicated

Check if any of this needs interpreter, if so, start with that
