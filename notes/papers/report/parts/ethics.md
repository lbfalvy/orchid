# Statement of Ethics

People other than the author, living creatures or experiments on infrastructure were not involved in the project, so the principles of **do no harm**, **confidentiality of data** and **informed consent** are not relevant.

As a language developer, my **social responsibility** is to build reliable languages. Orchid is a tool in service of whatever goal the programmer has in mind.
